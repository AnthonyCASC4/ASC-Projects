        <h3> Elon Musk is now Earth’s most future-oriented person. How did such a person come to be?</h3>
        <p> Elon Musk is trying to redefine transportation on earth and in space. Through Tesla Motors --
            of which he is cofounder, CEO and Chairman -- he is aiming to bring fully-electric vehicles to
             the mass market; at SpaceX he launches satellites and is working to send humans to other planets.
             It has been a meteoric rise for Musk, as both companies he helped found and still runs have skyrocketed
              in value and catapulted Musk into the national spotlight. But it hasn't been all smooth sailing.
               After a string of successful missions, a SpaceX rocket caught fire during fueling in September 2016
              , sending the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong.</p>
